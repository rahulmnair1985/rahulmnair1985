- 👋 Hi, I’m Rahul Nair

- 🌱 Becoming naked!
The term "open source" recently got deeply registered in my consciousness after we initiated plans to make our platform open source. This happened after a fruitful discussion with Mr. Kailash Nadh CTO @ Zerodhaonline and cofounder of FOSS UNITED . As I began researching open source, it provided me a new mental model to observe the world. The first book that landed in my hands was "Open Source Architecture" by Carlo Ratti, and I was simply amazed. Have you ever wondered why educational buildings, government buildings, and hospitals look the same? Read that book; you should understand it for yourself😊. I began to appreciate the beauty of open source and started learning about open source software projects and the power of the @github Github community

  As I delved deeper, I understood that I started to grow - or enjoy the journey - when I became 'naked'. That means I made myself an open source. My entire character, internal thoughts, internal chatters, my dark sides, my emotional triggers, my behavior, childhood memories, mood changes, desires, greed, lust - everything became transparent. If I engage in a conversation with someone, they can see me naked and raw. When I became that transparent, people began to share their observations, and I started adding those which were beneficial for the story I was building with my eight loved ones. I can see the speed at which the story is building. Open source is freedom and the path towards evolution.🦄
